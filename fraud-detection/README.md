**Author:** Ermias Brhane  
**Company:** Adey Innovations Inc.  

## Overview
This project focuses on building an end-to-end fraud detection pipeline for both e-commerce and bank transactions. The goal is to preprocess transaction data, engineer meaningful features, handle class imbalance, and prepare datasets for model training.

The pipeline includes:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering (time-based, frequency, and geolocation features)
- Handling highly imbalanced datasets
- Preparing datasets for machine learning modeling
